# Google Homepage Clone
This is my attempt at making a clone of the Google homepage for [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) fundamentals course.

This code is currently only for appearances. There is no search functionality of any kind. It is simply a test of my html and css abilities.

I had to borrow some elements from the Google Search page including the svg graphics for the magnifying glass and grid menu.
